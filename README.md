   ✨ Features 

    📊 1. AI Probability Predictor
- Uses a trained Machine Learning model   (Random Forest) to analyze student stats.
-   Inputs: CGPA, DSA Problems Solved, Projects, Hackathons, Certifications.
-   Output:   A percentage probability of being shortlisted for top-tier internships.

    🧠 2. Deep Profile Analysis (Gemini Powered)
- Goes beyond simple numbers to explain   "Why?"  
- Generates a custom HTML report highlighting strengths and weaknesses.
- Provides a   Personalized Roadmap   to fill skill gaps.

    🎓 3. Smart Learning Hub
-   Dynamic Topic Suggestions:   The AI extracts specific technical topics you need to learn.
-   One-Click Learning:   Click on suggested tags (e.g., "Learn Docker") to instantly find curated YouTube tutorials.
-   Custom Search:   A built-in search bar to find video resources for any other topic without leaving the dashboard.

    💬 4. AI Career Assistant (Chatbot)
- A conversational interface to ask specific questions about interviews, resume tips, or industry trends.
- Powered by Google's   Gemini-Pro   model.

    📱 5. Modern & Responsive UI

   ⚙️ Installation & Setup

    1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/internchance.git](https://github.com/yourusername/internchance.git)
cd internchance

```

    2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
  Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
  Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

```

    3. Install Dependencies

Create a `requirements.txt` file (if not present) with the following and install it:

```txt
flask
pandas
scikit-learn
google-generativeai

```

Run installation:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

    4. Set Up API Key

Open `app.py` and replace the placeholder API key with your actual   Google Gemini API Key  :

```python
genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE")

```

 (Note: It is best practice to use environment variables for API keys in production) 

    5. Train the Model (First Run Only)

Before running the app, ensure the ML model is trained and saved.

```bash
python train_model.py

```

This will generate `model.pkl` in your directory.

    6. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py

```
